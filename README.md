## ETL

This repo demonstrates a generic, modular workflow to Extract, Transform, and Load data.   
- Here, we extract data from [Citi Bike NYC's](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#Bikes) API.   
- We then perform basic transformations on the data.    
- Finally, we load the transformed data, in this case, to our local in csv format.
